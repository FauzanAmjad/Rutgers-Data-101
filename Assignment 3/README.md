Professor Moody has been teaching statistics 101 class for many years. His teaching evaluations went considerably south with the chief complaint:  he DOES NOT seem to assign grades fairly.   Students compared their scores among themselves and found quite a bit of discrepancies! But their complaints went nowhere since Professor promptly disappeared after posting the final grades and scores.

A new brave TA,  managed to get hold of the carefully maintained grading table (spanning multiple years) of professor Moody by ….messing a bit with Moody's computer….well,  let's not explain the details because he would get in trouble. What he found out was a remarkably structured account of how professor Moody assigns his grades.  

Looks like Professor Moody is in fact very alert in class. He is aware of  what students do,  detecting texting during class and remembering exactly who asked many questions in class.  He also keeps the mysterious "participation index" which is a numerical score from 0 to 1. This is probably related to questions asked and answered by students as well as their general attentivness in class.  Remarkable but a little creepy, isn't it?

What is the best advice the new TA, can give future students how to get a good grade in Professor Moody's class?  What factors influence the grade besides the score?   Back your recomendation  up with plots and evidence from the attached data.
