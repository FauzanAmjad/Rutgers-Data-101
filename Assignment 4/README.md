Take the  Moody data set from the previous assignment - attached here.

Pick  a hypothesis comparing impact of two "behaviours" on the score of the student. For example is average score of students who ALWAYS  ask questions higher than  average score of students who NEVER ask questions.  

Pick one hypothesis - and calculate p-value of your finding using z-test.  Select non-obvious hypotheses -i.e such that p-value will not simply be zero.  Thus, do NOT select average scores for grade  A vs average scores forgrade  F for example, A's average scores are clearly higher than F's average score, p=0 in this case.

Rather than that concentrate on behavioural attributes of students, such as ask_questions, on_smartphone etc
and find hypothesis which is "close" - so you get a non zero p-value.

Conclude with either rejecting NULL hypothesis or failing to reject it (yes this is the correct statement, double negation!)
