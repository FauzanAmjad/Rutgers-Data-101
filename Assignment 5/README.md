Given the attached data set you should argue  that  "Gun control is effective"

In our simulated data  each row describes a robberry.

Attributes (variables) incllude weapon used, monetary damage, weather at the time of robbery and the moon phase.  

Construct your hypothesis and show the p-value of your hypothesis using *permutation test* function. 

To defend your position better - put yourself in shoes of opponents of your posiiton - how could they argue against your hypothesis?  (i.e. if your name starts, say with S, how would someone with name which belongs to the group A, disagree with you - on what basis.  This data  and data only!  

Rubric:  Correct calculation of p-value using permutation test = 3 points
Correct hypothesis formation:  2 points

As always PDF (slides) + code in .R or in .txt.

EXTRA CREDIT (3 points) :  Can you built the case for the opposite point of view that "Gun control is not effective"?   No permutation test necessary - can you just show  plots convincing enough just to form  the hypothesis "Gun control is not effective"
